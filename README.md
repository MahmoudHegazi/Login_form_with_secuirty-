# Login_form_with_secuirty-
login form with user database and security, used hashed and salat and special function to encrypt user password , I used flask to write this app, how to use it just install vagrant and virtual box and run vagrant up then vagrant ssh then python database_setup.py and python  lyrics_new.py then open it in local host port 5000

This is RESTFull API with login function and logout and sginup 
I stored the user info in the login session
this is my first Own login form I used to use Oauth2 for handle login session


0 chance to get user password even  if you have the source code with you 
you will find yourself inside A maze 

## note
this is my own securty function I build it using my ownlogic 
there are many other good ways to make your login cus this it's not strong enogh alone so if you are begginer 
don't use this!!!
