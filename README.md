# Login_form_with_secuirty-
login form with user database and security, used hashed and salat and special function to encrypt user password , I used flask to write this app, how to use it just install vagrant and virtual box and run vagrant up then vagrant ssh then python database_setup.py and python  lyrics_new.py then open it in local host port 5000

This is RESTFull API with login function and logout and sginup 
I stored the user info in the login session
this is my first Own login form I used to use Oauth2 for handle login session
